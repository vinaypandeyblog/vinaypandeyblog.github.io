**Power Sector Round up - 2**

**Innovations**

1.Inspired by the aerodynamic wings of a condor, researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada, partnering with an industrial design firm,  designed a retrofit added to wind turbine blades, which can boost energy production by an average of 10%. 

2.Britain's RheEnergise is trying to replace the water with a 2.5 times more dense, heavy, paste-like fluid by mixing water with proprietary mineral powder called R19 . With this fluid one can get the same energy storage performance as traditional pumped hydro, using 40% the volume, much smaller tanks, and 40% the height differential between the upper and lower tanks. RheEnergy also claims the cost comes to less than that of large scale lithium-ion batteries.

**New Developments**

3.Coal Ministry mulls 6 mega power plants each with a capacity of 5,000 megawatts near its coalfield. Total investment planned is more than 2.5 lakh Crore. Out of 6, two are planned in Chhattisgarh, one at Korba and other at Mand-Raigarh coalfield. Odisha and Jharkhand will also have two plants each. They will be established through joint ventures (JVs) with the government, private power companies, and state-owned electricity generators. 

4.On 29th April NHPC Limited, has signed MOU with Norwegian company Ocean Sun to explore photovoltaic panels mounted on hydro elastic membranes. They will be used for floating solar plants. The ceremony was attended by the Ambesdors of two countries too.

5.Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd, signed its dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) project PPA with SJVN for a 460 MW. TPREL will develop a hybrid plant comprising solar, wind, and battery storage components. The FDRE enables Discoms in fulfilling their RPO and energy storage obligations (ESO). 

**Stats**

6.India's total installed capacity reached 442 GW. For the first time coal is less than 50%. RE is 144 GW (33%) and hydro is 47 GW (11%). 
In the RE capacity addition, Solar (including roof top) is highest 81% (15 GW). Wind is 3.3 GW & nuclear 1.4 GW. 

7.Highest supply record in May was recorded at 223.84 GW on 3rd May. Previously it was 1st May 23 was 221.42. 

8.Coal availability at power plants is 68% of norm. 

9.As per ICRA report India's renewable energy generation, including large hydro projects, is expected to reach 40% by 2030, up from current 25%. 

10.The tariff under BESS tenders havevmore than halved first SECI tender in August 22 to latest Gujrat tender in March 24. The reduction in battery costs from 2021 to 2023 lead to BESS cost dropped to Rs 6-7 Rs/ unit but they remain higher than PSP hydro which stands at about rs 5 per unit. However, the shorter gestation period and lower execution risks may favour BESS projects.
