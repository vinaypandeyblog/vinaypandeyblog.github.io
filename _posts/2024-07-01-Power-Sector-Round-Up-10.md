**Power Sector Roundup - 10**

**Intervention & Budgetary Expectations**

1.Union budget 24-25 may include ₹6,000 Cr VGF for Advanced Ultra Supercritical (AUSC) technology based 800 MW coal power plants. The project, based on technology developed by consortium of BHEL, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (AGCAR) and NTPC, is expected to cost Rs 15000 Cr plus. 

2.With sharp upsurge in Transmission, Metro and other infrastructure projects, the power Transformers are facing shortages. The lead time for 220 kV Xmers has increased from 8-9 months to 14-15 months. In general, 60 to 70% of order books are for RE projects especially Solar plants. Consequently, about 25% of RE projects face risk of delays. Govt intervention is required to ensure timely supply of raw material.

3.As per a CRISIL study, India faces vast divergence in RE cost. Solar -Rs. 2.6/kWh, Wind - Rs 3.4/kWh, Hybrid - Rs 4.1/kWh and offshore wind at Rs 6-6.5/kWh. This is inspite of  subsidies to offshore wind, during construction, to bring down its price by 28-30%.  For commercial viability, offshore wind may require VGF upto 2030. 

**Innovations / Contra-Views**

4.Vice Chairman & Jt MD of Bharat Forge, Amit Kalyani advanced a contra view on EVs - “_We are all following the wrong model because everybody is copying Chinese template ….which is a battery-based electric model”_. He advocated that as India is also building highways, we should incorporate inductive electric charging and battery to be used only when the EV is off the main highways. He contends that it will reduce battery size by 80%. 

**News – National**

5.With increase in coal production by 8-10 % and easing of transportation bottlenecks, power stations are stocked with 25% higher stock than last year. Currently national average coal stock with power stations is about 16 days.

6.Between July 5 & 18, price bids for 10 ISTS schemes, under TBCB are likely to be opened. Total estimated outlay is about Rs 36000 Cr. Biggest is ±800kV HVDC from Khavda Gujrat with outlay of about 25000 Cr.

7.As per a report, the apple-to-airport conglomerate Adani group is looking to invest about Rs 2 lakh Cr. by 2030 to build 40 GW RE capacity. Currently it has a portfolio of 21,953 MW (10,934 MW operational & 11,019 MW under execution). It includes 2000 MW Solar commissioned in FY24 at World's largest RE project of 30,000 MW, spanning 538 Sq km (almost 5 times the city of Paris) being built at Khavda, Gujarat. Interestingly, inspite of advocacy of market forces, about 93% of AGEL's current portfolio is backed by 25 yr PPAs with sovereign/ equivalent guarantees.

**News – International**

8.In a letter titled “Brother Sun” published on Wednesday, Pope Francis, asked the Vatican city to go green. The “Agrivoltaic” plant that will meet entire electricity need of the city state, will be set up in Santa Maria di Galeria, an extraterritorial area north of Rome. “Agrivoltaic” projects combine solar energy production and agriculture, with panels commonly installed above fields of crops or pasture land.

9.Chinese electrolyser maker Sungrow Hydrogen has won the tender for the world’s largest integrated green hydrogen, ammonia and methanol project. The $4.1bn facility of CEEC in Jilin, China, is expected to produce 110,000 tonnes of H2, 600,000 tonnes of green ammonia and 60,000 tonnes of green methanol annually.

**Commercial**

10.During the annual India Energy Storage Week (from July 1 to 5) organized by the industry body ‘India Energy Storage Alliance’ (IESA), India's energy storage sector is likely to see investments worth over ₹2,000 crore.

11.On June 26, BHEL bagged Rs 13,300 crore Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) order form DVC to set up 2X800MW thermal power plant in Koderma in Jharkhand. With this installed thermal generation capacity of DVC would go up to 8140 MW by 2030.

12.Brushing aside BHEL and L&T, the new flavour, Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltd (MEIL) has forayed in EPC of electrical reactors at Nuclear Power Stations. It has bagged Rs 12,800 Cr EPC tender by Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd (NPCIL) for construction of two 700 MW electrical reactors at Kaiga.

13.After tying up 13,000 MW RE and 750 MW battery storage of two cycles per day, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) entered in an MoU with Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC). The later will supply power to former from 5600 MW pit head stations to be installed at two mines acquired through auction at Odisha’s Angul and Sundargarh.
