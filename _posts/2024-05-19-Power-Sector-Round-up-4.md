**Power Sector Round up - 4**

**Policy Interventions**
1.MoP on 14th May has clarified that for projects set up under Section 63 of the Electricity Act 2003, wherein 'fuel cost pass through' is provided in PPA, the cost of biomass pellets shall also be pass through in the Energy Charge Rate. 

2.A scheme for installation of solar agricultural pumps under PM Kusum yojna is on drawing board. The PM Kusum scheme has 3 components - 1. Installation of 10000 MW solar capacity. 2. Installation of about 2 million stand alone solar pumps and 3. Solarization of about 1.5 million agricultural pumps. It is for the second part that a national portal, like the one launched for PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijali yojana is being planned. It will have 30% central subsidy but integration of 30% subsidy from state is challenging

3.Under the new guidelines, CPSUs / their JVs have now started direct submission of Solar/RE Park DPR to SECI & MNRE instead of asking for approval of DPR by the state govt committee. However private and State PSU developer have to obtain approval of the state energy department as per Nov.21 guidelines. 

4.A study, published in the journal "Nature Communications" on May 7, 2024, analysed financial impact of plans for coal phase-out. If China and India were to allow compensation measures akin to those already established in Europe, the projected compensation sum for both nations would be $2.4 trillion to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius target and $3.2 trillion for the 1.5°C target. The projected compensation figures for China & India rival the entire international climate finance pledged in Paris, surpassing current levels of international development aid to these countries.

**Innovations**

5.On May 11, China has put the first large-scale sodium-ion battery storage station into operation. A 10-MWh sodium-ion battery storage station at Nanning, Guangxi in southwestern China, is the first phase of an overall 100-MWh projet by China Southern Power Grid Energy Storage. The Sodium ion batteries are faster and carry low hazard risk. Importantly, due to easy and large scale availability of Sodium with large scale production it is expected to be 20-30% cheaper in comparison to Lithium,  making it a better choice for large-scale use.

6.In a significant move by Radiance, Indian RE firm planning expansion of RE capacity from 500 MW to 2GW in three years has introduced robotic cleaning for its solar panels. Company claims that it's robotics cleaners are dry and powered by solar energy, thus it is sustainable, saves water and allows more frequent cleaning. 

**Commercial Developments** -

7.NHPC has inked a loan of about 1100 Cr with JBIC, Japan for developing a 300 MW solar park at Bikaner. First of its kind cheap loan facility has been availed under GREEN Operations.

8.THDC plans to shutdown its hydro stations between June 1 to 1July 15, so as to commission it's first two Pump Storage units of 250 MW. After commissioning of all 4 PSP units of 250 MW, Tehri will supply upto 2400 MW in peak hrs. 

9.Adani Energy Solutions Ltd (AESL), India's largest private transmission and distribution company completes acquisition of  Essar Transco by 100% stake take over for an enterprise value of 1900 Cr. The Essar Transco assets include fully operational 400 kV, 673 circuit km inter-state transmission line, which connects Mahan in MP with Seepat looking station in Chhattisgarh. It strengthens AESL footprint in Central India where it operates four  assets totalling 3373 ckt km.

10.Following the footprint of parent company Siemens AG, Siemens India has decided to de-merge it's Energy business and list it separately. The move comes as market drivers and capital requirement in energy & industrial markets differ vastly.
