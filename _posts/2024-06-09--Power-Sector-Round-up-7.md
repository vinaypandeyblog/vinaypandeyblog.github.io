** Power Sector Round up - 7**

**Policy**

1.On 27th May, MNRE issued a OM exempting RE plants located within SEZs or Export Oriented Units (EOUs) and commissioned by 31.12.2030, from Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) requirements, provided they exclusively supply power to production plants of Green Hydrogen or its derivatives. 

2.With the new government taking over, an ambitious 100-days plan may hit the ground soon. Among top expectations are - a new hydro policy, subsidies for battery storage and India‚Äôs first offshore wind concession (NTPC announced 8.8GW of tenders this week). 

**EVENTS & PLANS - NATIONAL**

3.This week SECI started accepting bids to set up 1.2 GW (with single bids ranging from min. 50 MW to max. 600 MW) of solar projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. Generators with commissioned solar PV projects or under construction projects with untied capacity may participate. In a separate development, NTPC has also started accepting bids from RE developers to supply 1.2 GW of firm, dispatchable power from projects on BOO basis with Energy Storage Systems (min. single bid 50 MW, max 600 MW & incremental size 10 MW). In both cases, the project can be located anywhere in India and should be connected to the interstate transmission. 

4.NTPC is planning a major nuclear foray by setting up 10GW capacity¬†with an investment of ‚Çπ1.5 trillion over a period of 10 years. NTPC already has a JV with¬†Nuclear Power Corporation¬†for setting up two nuclear power plants in¬†Rajasthan (Banswara 4x700 MW) and MP (Chutaka 2x700 MW). Now NTPC is planning a wholly-owned subsidiary called "NTPC Nuclear Ltd". The 10GW nuclear capacity would be over and above NTPC's target of 60GW green power by 2032. Regarding nuclear power India, has currently¬†23 operational reactors with total 7.48 GW capacity. 10 more reactors are under construction and by 31-32 total capacity is expected to triple to about 22.48 GW. 

5.As per Moody's Rating, India's power sector is set to witness significant investment flows, driven primarily RE and Transmission projects. By 2030, RE is expected to attract $190-215 bn while T&D network will need $150-170 bn. However, with demand CAGR at 5%-6%, with likely addition of about 40 - 50 GW capacity coal may not be sidelined.

**BIG ONES  - INTERNATIONAL**

6.On Monday, June 3, world‚Äôs biggest solar¬†park of 5 GW capacity has come online in the desert region of north-west China. The facility covers 200,000 acres ‚Äì roughly the same area as New York City. The new solar farm overtakes the Ningxia Teneggeli and Golmud Wutumeiren solar projects, both in China (each 3 GW) to become the largest in the world. As per IEA (International Energy Agency) China commissioned as much solar capacity in 2023, as entire world did in 2022.

7.In a global first, on June 5, China's state owned Dongfang Electric Corporation, completed installation of a solitary 18 MW wind turbine at a coastal test base in South China‚Äôs Guangdong province. The turbine‚Äôs rotor diameter is a whopping 853 feet which sweeps an area of over 570,000 square feet, little bigger than 7 standard-sized football fields.¬†With expected annual gen. of 72 MU, about 40000 tons coal may be saved.

8.Just after weeks of completion of 100 MW hr (25 √ó4) GESS project near Shanghai, the technology innovator 'Energy Vault' has found a new partner in Burj Khalifa designer Chicago-based Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM). With Energy Vault, SOM  has designed prototypes that elevate massive blocks using electric motors to store the energy. The concept is similar to Pump Storage Plants, but without threat to ecology and biodiversity and is faster in implementation. While Shanghai project was about 150mtr high, SOM‚Äôs skyscrapers may start at 300 mtrs. Some other companies are also testing new GSS, using abandoned oil wells & mines. 

**Statistics**

9.India's leading electricity exchange, IEX,  has reported¬†28.9% YoY growth in trading volume in May 24. While Electricity trading surged by 21%, with record lower prices (on 29/5 - Rs 165)  Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) trade shot up by 640%. Significantly, while demand was up in May (250 GW+ on May 30), the DAM (Day Ahead Market) saw average MCP (Market Clearing Price) of Rs 5.30 per unit, about 20% less than prices discovered under bilateral contracts. Further RTM (Real Time Market) surged by more than 38%, which shows that Discoms are effectively balancing demand supply in real time. TAM (Term Ahead Market) moved up by 15%. Green DAM & TAM also were up by 79%. The average per unit price of GDAM and GTAM was Rs 3.86 & Rs 8.06. Energy Saving Certificates also registered trade of about 10 MU at floor price of 2165/ESCert.
