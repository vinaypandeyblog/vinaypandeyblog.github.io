**Power Sector Round Up -6**

**INNOVATIONS**
1.South Korean major Hanwha’s group company Qcells is using technology developed by Israeli startup Lumet to change cost of solar panels manufactured out of China. Transforming complex process of Metallisation, new process coats plastic films surface with silver paste, presses it onto preheated cells and then produces thinner silver fingers to increase amount of light captured by each solar cell. After completion of Qcells $2.5 billion Georgia project, it may be able to compete with  Chinese panels which are currently half priced in comparison to US. 

2.China plans government funding of 6 billion yuan (USD 830 million) to six firms to develop next generation solid state batteries which are safer, more stable and have longer battery life. The six firms include industry leader CATL, tech major WeLion and auto giant BYD. 

**Business Initiative**

3.NTPC has proposed to MoP to pool its “entire capacity”. Presently, PPAs specify particular plant and in some cases the stage from which power will be supplied. As per NTPC, proposal will allow discoms /states to get steady supply of power even in case of shutdown of units. For NTPC, it will allow operational flexibility, operation of units above Technical Min. Load & ease DSM implications. On the other hand, experts say that with pooling, states getting power from cheaper stations, may have to bear much higher power purchase cost.   

4.After floating subsideries for green power and solar panel manufacturing, Coal India has set up a JV named, Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Ltd (BCGCL), with BHEL for Coal to Chemical business. It has also entered into MoU with GAIl for entering into Coal to Natural gas segment.

5.MNRE new focus in wind power is on tendering for offshore. In February, MNRE issued a tender for seabed allocation for a sea area big enough to accommodate 4 GW of offshore wind capacity. The bids are to be opened in July. Further first tender with govt’s VGF support could be out as early as September – for 500 MW near Gujarat. 

**Statistics**

6.Wind power is on roll. Installations in current FY is expected to be 6.5-7 GW, compared to 3.2 GW last year and previous all time high of 5.4 GW in 2016-17. 

7.While the heatwave is pushing the demand up, it has a calming effect too.  Central Water Commission (CWC) has reported that soaring temperatures have increased the snow melting and Bhakra dam (power gen capacity 1325 MW)  has registered 10 feet higher water level.  Significant rise in water flow also noticed in Bhagirathi, Mandakini and Kali Nadi in Uttarakhand, denoting deterioration in glaciar health in Himalayan  region. 

**Smart Meters**
7.After Gujrat, Consumer activists in Mumbai are raising protest against Smart meter installations by BEST . Their contentions are - High Cost of meters (about Rs 12000) will lead to higher ARR, high maintenance cost and lower life (about 90 months) than conventional meters.   

**PROUD MOMENTS**

8.After the Punjab Govt appointed Shri Baldeo Singh, a career power engineer, Chairman of PSPCL, PSPCL has turned around from loss of 4375 Cr in FY 22-23 to unaudited profit of 900 Cr in FY 23-24. Even with increased demand, there is no power cut and no imported coal.  

9.All PSU employees to note that 56 listed PSUs made a combined record profit of Rs 5 lakh crore in FY24. Here are India’s 10 most profitable PSUs
