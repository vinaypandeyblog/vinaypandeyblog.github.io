**Power Sector Round up - 5**

**Innovations**

1.Researchers from School of Engineering of "UnFoLD Labs" in a paper published in “Nature Communications" have come up with a game changing research on windmills. At present, windmills used are Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) but the first windmills of 8th century (used for grinding grain) were Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). VAWT are less noisy and achieve greater wind energy density but dynamic stall increases  risk of vortex and threat to foundation Stability. Researchers using a combination of Sensor technology & Machine Learning have worked out computer based algorithm to configure & control multiple optimal profiles for VAWT blades, which will use dynamic stall to provide higher propulsion instead of vibrations. It will achieve a 200% increase in turbine efficiency and 77% reduction in structure threatening vibrations. To build a proof of concept VAWT, a bridge grant has been issued by Swiss National Science Foundation and Innosuisse . 

**Court & Regulatory Interventions**

2.In a big relief to Himachal Govt, Supreme Court stayed HP High Court order on water cess. After the Central govt declared that states cannot impose water cess,  on a petition filed by NHPC & others, on March 5, Highcourt declared Section 10 & 15 of HP Water Cess Act & the Rules as ultra vires and ordered refund of Cess so collected. For Himachal, water cess is big money amounting to about Rs 2,000 crore annually. The final outcome may have impact on Bango and SHP tariff and also on viability of PSPs in Chhattisgarh.

3.On May 21, 2024 Shri Ramesh Babu V. has taken over the charge of Member, CERC. A career NTPC person, he served as Director (Operations), NTPC from May 2020 till his retirement on 31.01.24.

4.In order to align Regulations with Electricity (Right of Consumers) Rules, 2020 GERC has floated Draft Net Metering Rooftop Solar PV Grid Interactive Systems (4th Amendment) Regulations, 2024. Main features of draft include exemption of rooftop systems up to 10 KW from technical feasibility study and exemption of installations up to 6 Kw from infrastructure strengthening charges. The cost will be charged to ARR. 

5.RERC on a petition filed by RUVNL has adopted discovered tariff of about Rs 3.03/ unit for 810 MW bid won by NLC in the Ultra Mega Solar Park being established at Barmer.  

 Statistics / Achievements

6.In a record breaking transition, India added about 10 GW Solar Capacity in the 1st quarter of 2024. It is about 5 times on YoY basis. In the 1st quarter of 2023, it was 2 GW. 

7.As per a ToI report, day before yesterday, on Friday ,the searing heat wave sweeping across most parts of India pushed peak power demand past Centre’s estimate to hit almost 240 GW (gigawatts) — the highest this year —  and looks set to top the all-time record of 243.2 GW. Officials say this year peak may touch 260 GW. 

**Future Growth**

8.As per a CRISIL Report, driven by the need for grid balancing and continuous power supply, India may add about 25 GB wind energy capacity by 2028 with capital expenditure of about 2,00,000 Cr. While annual capacity addition during 2014 to 18 was about 3 GW, during 2018 to 23 it came down to 1.7 GW.  Thus the projections indicate about 3-4 times surge in annual capacity addition.

9.Last week, during visit of Secretary Atomic Energy Ajit Kumar Mohanty, to Pilot Demonstration Energy Complex in Seversk, Russia offered cooperation in construction of high capacity nuclear power units at a new site in India. At present at Kundakulam Nuclear Power project,  Russian design based 6 units of 1000 MW each, equipped with light water reactors, are under construction, two of which have already been commissioned. 

**Unexpected**

10.In light of the protests which started on 14 May from Vadodara and soon spread to Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Anand, Godhra and Dahod, Smart meter installation in Gujrat had now been put on hold. After a high-level meeting, it was decided that ‘check meters’ (old meters) will be installed alongside smart meters in government offices, and consumers will be invited to see their functioning to “dispel any misinformation” and “win back their confidence”, before carrying out installation in residential areas. GUVNL has also decided that it will install check meters for every consumer who insists on getting one. Under RDSS Gujrat has to install 1.64 crore smart meters out of which about 60,000 have been installed so far.
