**Power Sector Round up 9**

**Policy**

1.On June 14, MoP issued Guidelines for payment of Right of Way (Row) compensation concerning transmission lines including those in urban areas. Along with the detailed SOP, it addresses issues related to Authority, Determination of compensation, Alternate compensation, Areas with RoW constraints, Landowner identification etc. While States/UTs are allowed to adopt these guidelines or issue their own modified guidelines, in absence of State guidelines, these guidelines shall apply.

**Innovations**

2.The world’s firs flue gas CO2 to 4G ethanol project is going to be implemented at NTPC's Lara STPS, the plant conceptualised and designed by NETRA (NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance). Bid for setting up the plant to produce 4G ethanol from flue gas has been begged by Jakson Green. Using latest carbon capture technology, the plant will capture 25 TPD CO2 from flue gases. Also, 3 tonnes per day of green hydrogen will be generated through 7.5 MW electrolyser. Captured CO2 & generated H2 will be combined to form 4G ethanol via microbial fermentation technology. 

3.With off shore wind turbines becoming talk of the town, last year Swedish state-owned power firm Vattenfall and Denmark's Aarhus University commissioned a 4 yr research project on the potential to grow sea food beneath the offshore wind turbines. With its first harvest just 18 months later, it's already showing signs of early success. 

**News – National**

4.On June 19, The Union Cabinet, approved  Viability Gap Funding (VGF) of Rs.7453 crore for offshore wind energy projects of 1 GW (500 MW each, off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu). It also includes grant of Rs.600 crore for upgradation of two ports to meet logistics requirements. The projects will be established by TBCB and power evacuation infrastructure will be constructed by PGCIL. 

5.On June 22, MoP cleared 2 Transmission projects costing about 13,600 Cr to evacuate 9 GW of RE power (part of the 500 GW target by 2030) from Rajasthan and Karnataka. Projects will be executed by TBCB.


**News – International** 

6.The Energy Institute (EI), in collaboration with KPMG and Keanery has issued 73rd edition of “Statistical Review of World Energy”. It states that 2023 was a year of production and consumption records. Regarding regional imbalances it observes that while Africa and South Asia were responsible for less than 10% of world’s energy demand, they are positioned for significant energy demand growth. During the year, total primary energy consumption increased by 2% reaching 620 EJ (Exa Joule = 10^18 Joules). While electricity demand grew 25% faster than total primary energy consumption, on supply side, RE grew at 6 times the rate of total primary energy.

**Plans & Forecasts**

7.With addition of 15.4 GW by March 2025, current FY may mark largest thermal capacity increase in a decade. Last year, India announced plans to bolster its coal-fired capacity by nearly 90 GW by 2032. About 28.5 GW is under construction, with plans to award contracts for an additional 50 GW over the next three years.

8.CRISIL estimates that India’s key infrastructure sectors - RE, Roads & Real estate are expected to grow ~38% in fiscals 25 and 26 compared with previous two fiscals. For RE, FY 24 saw auctions of 35 GW, the highest ever in a single fiscal, resulting in a strong pipeline of 75 GW primarily driving implementation of 50 GW over next two fiscals.

9.Adani Green claims to plan investmeny INR 25,000-27,500 crore ($3 bn) in building its first pumped-storage facility.  It aims to establish 5 GW of PSH capacity in next 5 years and eventually increase it to 25 GW. This is in addition to Group's proclaimed investment of more than $100 bn in energy transition space. The group claims to be building world’s largest single-site 30 GW RE park at Khavda in the Kutch region of Gujarat.
