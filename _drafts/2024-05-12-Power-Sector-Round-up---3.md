**Power Sector Round up - 3**

**Innovations / Policy Interventions**

1.The world's first 100 MWh GESS (Gravity Energy Storage System) project "Rudong EVx" has been commissioned in China. Based on Swiss company Energy Vault’s solution, it employs massive concrete blocks to store and release electricity. This mammoth building-sized storage capacity has 35 year operational life with 4 hr cycle and impressive 80%  plus efficiency.  

2.In a bid to induce competition, CEA has relaxed the PQR for EPC bids for Super critical thermal stations. Now experience in sub-critical technology will also be allowed for super critical  plants. Generators may also be asked to opt for split / package based tenders. Resultantly Companies like GE, Thermax may get entry. 

**New Developments**

3.India has surpassed Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator. Solar is the world's fastest growing electricity source adding more than twice capacity in 2023 than coal. In terms of capacity additional in 2023, India stood fourth (18 TWh) behind Brazil (22 TWh), USA (33 TWh) & China (156TWh). 

4.A study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water says India's solar waste is expected to jump to 600,000 tonnes by 2030 from the current 100,000 tonnes due to rapid deployment of new solar capacities.  Solar capacity of around 292 GW is likely to be deployed by 2030, making solar PV waste management crucial. Most of this waste is likely to come from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh & TamilNadu.

5.Expert group 'Devdiscourse' report states that India's solar drive may get hampered by fears of DISCOMs losing income, a shortage of skilled workers to make, install and service solar panels, and the proliferation of substandard products. The report states "Imagine millions of homes being hooked up to the grid and injecting their excess electricity in a system that is already facing so many technical losses," 

6.Ministries of Renewable energy & Skill development are jointly working on a plan to train a workforce of 1,00,000 to install and manage solar panels under PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijali Yojana.They also plan to train 50,000 vendors.

**Stats**

7.According to government sources, with projections indicating a shortfall of 14 GW during nighttime hours, India is gearing up to tackle its most significant power deficit in 14 years this June. The impending deficit is propelled by a decline in hydropower generation and exacerbated by delays in commissioning 3.6 GW of new coal-fired plants, originally slated for operation before March. 

8.According to think tank Ember,Coal-fired electricity output hit 338 terawatt hours during the first quarter of 2024,  which marked a 9.6% rise from the same quarter in 2023. Total power sector emissions also climbed by the same degree to a record 316 million metric tons of CO2 & equivalent gases.

9.GUVNL (Gujrat Urja) has filed a petition before GSERC seeking approval for tariff rates discovered through competitive bidding process for procurement of storage capacity from a standalone Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project.Gensol Engineering Limited and IndiGrid have bid tariff rates of about ₹4.49 lakh per MW per month (about Rs 4 per kWh for storage) for 70 MW/140 MWh capacity and 180 MW/360 MWh capacity.
