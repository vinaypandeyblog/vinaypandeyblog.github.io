*Innovations*

1.Inspired by the aerodynamic wings of a condor, researchers¬†from the University of Alberta in Canada, partnering with an industrial design firm,  designed a retrofit added to wind turbine blades, which can boost energy production by an average of¬†10%. 

2.Britain's RheEnergise¬†is trying to replace the water with a 2.5 times more dense, heavy, paste-like fluid by mixing water with proprietary mineral powder called R19 . With this fluid one can get the same energy storage performance as traditional pumped hydro, using 40% the volume, much smaller tanks, and 40% the height differential between the upper and lower tanks. RheEnergy also claims the cost comes to less than that of large scale lithium-ion batteries.

*New Developments*

3.Coal Ministry mulls 6 mega power plants each with a capacity of 5,000 megawatts near its coalfield. Total investment planned is more than 2.5 lakh Crore. Out of 6, two are planned in Chhattisgarh, one at Korba and other at Mand-Raigarh coalfield. Odisha and Jharkhand will also have two plants each. They will be established through joint ventures (JVs) with the government, private power companies, and state-owned electricity generators. 

4.On 29th April NHPC Limited, has signed MOU with Norwegian company Ocean Sun to explore photovoltaic panels mounted on hydro elastic membranes. They will be used for floating solar plants. The ceremony was attended by the Ambesdors of two countries too.

5.Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd, signed its dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) project PPA with SJVN for a 460 MW. TPREL will develop a hybrid plant comprising solar, wind, and battery storage components. The FDRE¬†enables Discoms in fulfilling their RPO and energy storage obligations (ESO). 

*Stats*

6.India's total installed capacity reached 442 GW. For the first time coal is less than 50%. RE is 144 GW (33%) and hydro is 47 GW (11%). 
In the RE capacity addition, Solar (including roof top) is highest 81% (15 GW). Wind is 3.3 GW & nuclear 1.4 GW. 

7.Highest supply record in May was recorded at 223.84 GW on 3rd May. Previously it was 1st May 23 was 221.42. 

8.Coal availability at power plants is 68% of norm. 

9.As per ICRA report India's renewable energy generation, including large hydro projects, is expected¬†to reach 40% by 2030, up from current 25%. 

10.The tariff under BESS tenders havevmore than halved first SECI tender in August 22 to latest Gujrat tender in March 24. The reduction in battery costs from 2021 to 2023 lead to BESS cost dropped to Rs 6-7 Rs/ unit but they remain higher than PSP hydro which stands at about rs 5 per unit. However, the shorter gestation period and lower execution risks may favour BESS projects.

*Innovations / Policy Interventions*

1.The world's first 100 MWh GESS (Gravity Energy Storage System) project "Rudong EVx" has been commissioned in China. Based on Swiss company Energy Vault‚Äôs solution, it employs massive concrete blocks to store and release electricity. This mammoth building-sized storage capacity has 35 year operational life with 4 hr cycle and impressive 80%  plus efficiency.  

2.In a bid to induce competition, CEA has relaxed the PQR for EPC bids for Super critical thermal stations. Now experience in sub-critical technology will also be allowed for super critical  plants. Generators may also be asked to opt for split / package based tenders. Resultantly Companies like GE, Thermax may get entry. 

*New Developments*

3.India has surpassed Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator. Solar is the world's fastest growing electricity source adding more than twice capacity in 2023 than coal. In terms of capacity additional in 2023, India stood fourth (18 TWh) behind Brazil (22 TWh), USA (33 TWh) & China (156TWh). 

4.A study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water says India's¬†solar waste¬†is expected to jump to 600,000 tonnes by 2030 from the current 100,000 tonnes due to rapid deployment of new¬†solar capacities.  Solar capacity of around 292 GW is likely to be deployed by 2030, making¬†solar PV waste¬†management crucial. Most of this waste is likely to come from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh &¬†TamilNadu.

5.Expert group 'Devdiscourse' report states that India's solar drive may get hampered by fears of DISCOMs losing income, a shortage of skilled workers to make, install and service solar panels, and the proliferation of substandard products. The report states "Imagine millions of homes being hooked up to the grid and injecting their excess electricity in a system that is already facing so many technical losses," 

6.Ministries of Renewable energy & Skill development are jointly working on a plan to train a workforce of 1,00,000 to install and manage solar panels under PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijali Yojana.They also plan to train 50,000 vendors.

*Stats*

7.According to government sources, with projections indicating a shortfall of 14 GW during nighttime hours, India is gearing up to tackle its most significant power deficit in 14 years this June. The impending deficit is propelled by a decline in hydropower generation and exacerbated by delays in commissioning 3.6 GW of new coal-fired plants, originally slated for operation before March. 

8.According to think tank Ember,Coal-fired electricity output hit 338 terawatt hours during the first quarter of 2024,  which marked a 9.6% rise from the same quarter in 2023. Total power sector emissions also climbed by the same degree to a record 316 million metric tons of CO2 & equivalent gases.

9.GUVNL (Gujrat Urja) has filed a petition before GSERC seeking approval for tariff rates discovered through competitive bidding process for procurement of storage capacity from a standalone Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project.Gensol Engineering Limited and IndiGrid have bid tariff rates of about ‚Çπ4.49 lakh per MW per month (about Rs 4 per kWh for storage) for 70 MW/140 MWh capacity and 180 MW/360 MWh capacity.

*Policy Interventions*
1.MoP on 14th May has clarified that for projects set up under Section 63 of the Electricity Act 2003, wherein 'fuel cost pass through' is provided in PPA, the cost of biomass pellets shall also be pass through in the Energy Charge Rate. 

2.A scheme for installation of solar agricultural pumps under PM Kusum yojna is on drawing board. The PM Kusum scheme has 3 components - 1. Installation of 10000 MW solar capacity. 2. Installation of about 2 million stand alone solar pumps and 3. Solarization of about 1.5 million agricultural pumps. It is for the second part that a national portal, like the one launched for PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijali yojana is being planned. It will have 30% central subsidy but integration of 30% subsidy from state is challenging

3.Under the new guidelines, CPSUs / their JVs have now started direct submission of Solar/RE Park DPR to SECI & MNRE instead of asking for approval of DPR by the state govt committee. However private and State PSU developer have to obtain approval of the state energy department as per Nov.21 guidelines. 

4.A study, published in the journal¬†"Nature Communications"¬†on May 7, 2024, analysed financial impact of plans for coal phase-out. If China and India were to allow compensation measures akin to those already established in Europe, the projected compensation sum for both nations would be $2.4 trillion to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius target and $3.2 trillion for the 1.5¬∞C target. The projected compensation figures for China & India rival the entire international climate finance pledged in Paris, surpassing current levels of international development aid to these countries.

*Innovations*

5.On May 11, China has put the first large-scale sodium-ion battery storage station into operation. A 10-MWh sodium-ion battery storage station at Nanning, Guangxi in southwestern China, is the first phase of an overall 100-MWh projet by China Southern Power Grid Energy Storage. The Sodium ion batteries are faster and carry low hazard risk. Importantly, due to easy and large scale availability of Sodium with large scale production it is expected to be 20-30% cheaper in comparison to Lithium,  making it a better choice for large-scale use.

6.In a significant move by Radiance, Indian RE firm planning expansion of RE capacity from 500 MW to 2GW in three years has introduced robotic cleaning for its solar¬†panels. Company claims that it's robotics cleaners are dry and powered by solar energy, thus it is sustainable, saves water and allows more frequent cleaning. 

*Commercial Developments* -

7.NHPC has inked a loan of about 1100 Cr with JBIC, Japan for developing a 300 MW solar park at Bikaner. First of its kind cheap loan facility has been availed under GREEN Operations.

8.THDC plans to shutdown its hydro stations between June 1 to 1July 15, so as to commission it's first two Pump Storage units of 250 MW. After commissioning of all 4 PSP units of 250 MW, Tehri will supply upto 2400 MW in peak hrs. 

9.Adani Energy Solutions Ltd (AESL), India's largest private transmission and distribution company completes acquisition of  Essar Transco by 100% stake take over for an enterprise value of 1900 Cr. The Essar Transco assets include fully operational 400 kV, 673 circuit km inter-state transmission line, which connects Mahan in MP with Seepat looking station in Chhattisgarh. It strengthens AESL footprint in Central India where it operates four  assets totalling 3373 ckt km.

10.Following the footprint of parent company Siemens AG, Siemens India has decided to de-merge it's Energy business and list it separately. The move comes as market drivers and capital requirement in energy & industrial markets differ vastly.

*Innovations*

1.Researchers from School of Engineering of "UnFoLD Labs" in a paper published in ‚ÄúNature Communications" have come up with a game changing research on windmills. At present, windmills¬†used are Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) but the first windmills of 8th century (used for grinding grain) were Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). VAWT are less noisy and achieve greater wind energy density but dynamic stall increases  risk of vortex and threat to foundation Stability. Researchers using a combination of Sensor technology & Machine Learning have worked out computer based algorithm to configure & control multiple optimal profiles for VAWT blades, which will use dynamic stall to provide higher propulsion instead of vibrations. It will achieve a 200% increase in turbine efficiency and 77% reduction in structure threatening vibrations. To build a proof of concept VAWT, a bridge grant has been issued by Swiss National Science Foundation and Innosuisse . 

*Court & Regulatory Interventions*

2.In a big relief to Himachal Govt, Supreme Court stayed HP High Court order on water cess. After the Central govt declared that states cannot impose water cess,  on a petition filed by NHPC & others, on March 5, Highcourt declared Section 10 & 15 of HP Water Cess Act & the Rules as ultra vires and ordered refund of Cess so collected. For Himachal, water cess is big money amounting to about Rs 2,000 crore annually. The final outcome may have impact on Bango and SHP tariff and also on viability of PSPs in Chhattisgarh.

3.On May 21, 2024 Shri Ramesh Babu V. has taken over the charge of Member, CERC. A career NTPC person, he served as Director (Operations), NTPC from May 2020 till his retirement on 31.01.24.

4.In order to align Regulations with Electricity (Right of Consumers) Rules, 2020 GERC has floated Draft Net Metering Rooftop Solar PV Grid Interactive Systems (4th Amendment) Regulations, 2024. Main features of draft include exemption of rooftop systems up to 10 KW from technical feasibility study and exemption of installations up to 6 Kw from infrastructure strengthening charges. The cost will be charged to ARR. 

5.RERC on a petition filed by RUVNL has adopted discovered tariff of about Rs 3.03/ unit for 810 MW bid won by NLC in the Ultra Mega Solar Park being established at Barmer.  

¬†Statistics / Achievements

6.In a record breaking transition, India added about 10 GW Solar Capacity in the 1st quarter of 2024. It is about 5 times on YoY basis. In the 1st quarter of 2023, it was 2 GW. 

7.As per a ToI report, day before yesterday, on Friday ,the searing heat wave sweeping across most parts of India pushed peak power demand past Centre‚Äôs estimate to hit almost 240 GW (gigawatts) ‚Äî the highest this year ‚Äî  and looks set to top the all-time record of 243.2 GW. Officials say this year peak may touch 260 GW. 

*Future Growth*

8.As per a CRISIL Report, driven by the need for grid balancing and continuous power supply, India may add about 25 GB wind energy capacity by 2028 with capital expenditure of about 2,00,000 Cr. While annual capacity addition during 2014 to 18 was about 3 GW, during 2018 to 23 it came down to 1.7 GW. ¬†Thus the projections indicate about 3-4 times surge in annual capacity addition.

9.Last week, during visit of Secretary Atomic Energy Ajit Kumar Mohanty, to Pilot Demonstration Energy Complex in Seversk, Russia offered cooperation in construction of high capacity nuclear power units at a new site in India. At present at Kundakulam Nuclear Power project,  Russian design based 6 units of 1000 MW each, equipped with light water reactors, are under construction, two of which have already been commissioned.¬†

*Unexpected*

10.In light of the protests which started on 14 May from Vadodara and soon spread to¬†Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Anand, Godhra and Dahod, Smart meter installation in Gujrat had now been put on hold. After a high-level meeting, it was decided that ‚Äòcheck meters‚Äô (old meters) will be installed alongside smart meters in government offices, and consumers will be invited to see their functioning to ‚Äúdispel any misinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúwin back their confidence‚Äù, before carrying out installation in residential areas. GUVNL has also decided that it will install check meters for every consumer who insists on getting one. Under RDSS Gujrat has to install 1.64 crore smart meters out of which about 60,000 have been installed so far.

*INNOVATIONS*
1.South Korean major¬†Hanwha‚Äôs group company Qcells is using technology developed by¬†Israeli startup Lumet to change cost of solar panels manufactured out of China. Transforming complex¬†process of Metallisation, new process coats plastic films¬†surface¬†with silver paste, presses it onto preheated cells and then¬†produces thinner silver fingers to increase amount of light captured by each solar cell. After completion of Qcells¬†$2.5 billion Georgia project, it may be able to compete with  Chinese panels which are currently half priced in comparison to US. 

2.China plans government funding of 6 billion yuan (USD 830 million) to six firms to develop next generation solid state batteries which are safer, more stable and have longer battery life. The six firms include industry leader CATL, tech major WeLion and auto giant BYD. 

*Business Initiative*

3.NTPC has proposed to MoP to pool its ‚Äúentire capacity‚Äù. Presently, PPAs specify particular plant and in some cases the stage from which power will be supplied. As per NTPC, proposal will allow¬†discoms /states to get steady supply of power even in case of shutdown of units. For NTPC, it will allow¬†operational flexibility, operation of units above Technical Min. Load & ease DSM implications. On the other hand, experts say that with pooling, states getting power from cheaper stations, may have to bear much higher power¬†purchase cost.¬† ¬†

4.After floating subsideries for green power and solar panel manufacturing, Coal India has set up a JV named, Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Ltd (BCGCL),¬†with BHEL¬†for Coal¬†to Chemical business. It has also¬†entered¬†into MoU with GAIl for entering into Coal to Natural gas segment.

5.MNRE new focus in wind power is on tendering for offshore. In February, MNRE issued a tender for seabed allocation for a sea area big enough to accommodate 4 GW of offshore wind capacity. The bids are to be opened in July. Further¬†first tender with govt‚Äôs VGF support could be out as early as September ‚Äì for 500 MW near Gujarat.¬†

*Statistics*

6.Wind power is on roll. Installations in current FY is expected to be 6.5-7 GW, compared to 3.2 GW last year and previous all time high of 5.4 GW in 2016-17. 

7.While the heatwave is pushing the demand up, it has a calming effect¬†too.  Central Water Commission (CWC) has reported that soaring temperatures have increased the snow melting and Bhakra dam (power gen capacity 1325 MW)  has registered¬†10 feet higher water level.  Significant rise in water flow also noticed in Bhagirathi, Mandakini and Kali Nadi in Uttarakhand, denoting deterioration¬†in glaciar¬†health in Himalayan¬† region.¬†

*Smart Meters*
7.After Gujrat, Consumer activists in Mumbai are raising¬†protest against Smart meter installations by BEST . Their contentions are - High Cost of meters (about Rs 12000) will lead¬†to higher ARR, high maintenance cost and lower life (about 90 months)¬†than conventional meters.¬† ¬†

*PROUD MOMENTS*

8.After the Punjab Govt appointed Shri Baldeo Singh, a career power engineer, Chairman of PSPCL, PSPCL has turned around from loss of 4375 Cr in FY 22-23 to unaudited profit of 900 Cr in FY 23-24. Even with increased demand, there is no power cut and no imported coal.¬†¬†

*Policy*

1.On 27th May, MNRE issued a OM exempting RE plants located within SEZs or Export Oriented Units (EOUs) and commissioned by 31.12.2030, from Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) requirements, provided they exclusively supply power to production plants of Green Hydrogen or its derivatives. 

2.With the new government taking over, an ambitious 100-days plan may hit the ground soon. Among top expectations are - a new hydro policy, subsidies for battery storage and India‚Äôs first offshore wind concession (NTPC announced 8.8GW of tenders this week). 

*EVENTS & PLANS - NATIONAL*

3.This week SECI started accepting bids to set up 1.2 GW (with single bids ranging from min. 50 MW to max. 600 MW) of solar projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. Generators with commissioned solar PV projects or under construction projects with untied capacity may participate. In a separate development, NTPC has also started accepting bids from RE developers to supply 1.2 GW of firm, dispatchable power from projects on BOO basis with Energy Storage Systems (min. single bid 50 MW, max 600 MW & incremental size 10 MW). In both cases, the project can be located anywhere in India and should be connected to the interstate transmission. 

4.NTPC is planning a major nuclear foray by setting up 10GW capacity¬†with an investment of ‚Çπ1.5 trillion over a period of 10 years. NTPC already has a JV with¬†Nuclear Power Corporation¬†for setting up two nuclear power plants in¬†Rajasthan (Banswara 4x700 MW) and MP (Chutaka 2x700 MW). Now NTPC is planning a wholly-owned subsidiary called "NTPC Nuclear Ltd". The 10GW nuclear capacity would be over and above NTPC's target of 60GW green power by 2032. Regarding nuclear power India, has currently¬†23 operational reactors with total 7.48 GW capacity. 10 more reactors are under construction and by 31-32 total capacity is expected to triple to about 22.48 GW. 

5.As per Moody's Rating, India's power sector is set to witness significant investment flows, driven primarily RE and Transmission projects. By 2030, RE is expected to attract $190-215 bn while T&D network will need $150-170 bn. However, with demand CAGR at 5%-6%, with likely addition of about 40 - 50 GW capacity coal may not be sidelined.

*BIG ONES  - INTERNATIONAL*

6.On Monday, June 3, world‚Äôs biggest solar¬†park of 5 GW capacity has come online in the desert region of north-west China. The facility covers 200,000 acres ‚Äì roughly the same area as New York City. The new solar farm overtakes the Ningxia Teneggeli and Golmud Wutumeiren solar projects, both in China (each 3 GW) to become the largest in the world. As per IEA (International Energy Agency) China commissioned as much solar capacity in 2023, as entire world did in 2022.

7.In a global first, on June 5, China's state owned Dongfang Electric Corporation, completed installation of a solitary 18 MW wind turbine at a coastal test base in South China‚Äôs Guangdong province. The turbine‚Äôs rotor diameter is a whopping 853 feet which sweeps an area of over 570,000 square feet, little bigger than 7 standard-sized football fields.¬†With expected annual gen. of 72 MU, about 40000 tons coal may be saved.

8.Just after weeks of completion of 100 MW hr (25 √ó4) GESS project near Shanghai, the technology innovator 'Energy Vault' has found a new partner in Burj Khalifa designer Chicago-based Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM). With Energy Vault, SOM  has designed prototypes that elevate massive blocks using electric motors to store the energy. The concept is similar to Pump Storage Plants, but without threat to ecology and biodiversity and is faster in implementation. While Shanghai project was about 150mtr high, SOM‚Äôs skyscrapers may start at 300 mtrs. Some other companies are also testing new GSS, using abandoned oil wells & mines. 

*Statistics*

9.India's leading electricity exchange, IEX,  has reported¬†28.9% YoY growth in trading volume in May 24. While Electricity trading surged by 21%, with record lower prices (on 29/5 - Rs 165)  Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) trade shot up by 640%. Significantly, while demand was up in May (250 GW+ on May 30), the DAM (Day Ahead Market) saw average MCP (Market Clearing Price) of Rs 5.30 per unit, about 20% less than prices discovered under bilateral contracts. Further RTM (Real Time Market) surged by more than 38%, which shows that Discoms are effectively balancing demand supply in real time. TAM (Term Ahead Market) moved up by 15%. Green DAM & TAM also were up by 79%. The average per unit price of GDAM and GTAM was Rs 3.86 & Rs 8.06. Energy Saving Certificates also registered trade of about 10 MU at floor price of 2165/ESCert.
